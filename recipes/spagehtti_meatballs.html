            <h3>The meatballs:</h3>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Heat 2 tbsp of the oil in a small frying pan over a medium heat. Add the garlic and cook until soft, about 1 1/2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Whisk together the eggs and parsley in a large bowl. Add the browned garlic, meats and cheese and gently mix together until combined.</li>
                <li>Begin adding breadcrumbs 1 tbsp at a time until the mixture just holds together. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes./li>
                <li>Heat the remaining oil in a large frying pan over a high heat. Form the meat into 4cm balls, add to the pan and fry until golden brown on all sides. Carefully remove to a baking sheet lined with paper towels./li>                 
            </ol>
