    <h3>The meatballs:</h3>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Heat 2 tbsp of the oil in a small frying pan over a medium heat. Add the garlic and cook until soft,
            about 1 1/2 minutes.</li>

            mix together until combined.</li>
        <li>Begin adding breadcrumbs 1 tbsp at a time until the mixture just holds together. Season with salt and
            pepper, to taste. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes./li>
        <li>Heat the remaining oil in a large frying pan over a high heat. Form the meat into 4cm balls, add to the
            pan and fry until golden brown on all sides. Carefully remove to a baking sheet lined with paper
            towels./li>

            cook until the onion is soft. Add the tomato puree and cook for 30 seconds./li>
        <li>Stir in the tomatoes and leave to simmer, uncovered, for about 10 minutes. Add the peppers and parsley
