This is a simple website with a few recipe pages, made as an assignment for The Odin Project.

By the end of this project I will have demonstrated a very basic understanding
of HTML and how to build a website.

I ended up making two recipe pages, using the Spaghetti and Meatballs page as a template for Chocolate Chips oage.
I plan on adding more in the future when I feel like I have more knowledge to apply.
